      <h2>// Axioms in security</h2>
      <p>
        In logic, an axiom is a statement taken as given; in security, it's your root of trust: a firmware hash, a root
        CA public key, a secure enclave's integrity. Both share a property: they cannot be proven <em>from within</em> the
        system they protect. Compromise them, and the entire logical edifice collapses.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cyber-section" id="incompleteness">
      <h2>// Incompleteness in formal verification pipelines</h2>
      <p>
        Gödel's first incompleteness theorem implies that any verification tool expressive enough to model realistic
        software will have security-relevant truths it cannot prove. For example, proving absence of all buffer
        overflows for arbitrary binaries is equivalent to solving an undecidable reachability problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, verification pipelines (e.g., Frama-C, Dafny, Coq-backed provers) mitigate this by restricting the
        language subset or imposing finite bounds. This yields decidable fragments but leaves residual risk — the
        attacker's playground.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cyber-section" id="halting">
      <h2>// Halting problem, Rice's theorem & detection boundaries</h2>
      <p>
        The Halting Problem ensures there is no total function that, for all binaries <em>B</em> and inputs <em>I</em>,
        returns whether <em>B(I)</em> halts. Malware detection for arbitrary code is reducible to such undecidable
        predicates. Rice's theorem strengthens this: any non-trivial semantic property (e.g., “will this binary execute
        a network beacon?”) is undecidable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security products sidestep this by using heuristics, ML classifiers, and restricted execution traces, accepting
        both false negatives and false positives as trade-offs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cyber-section" id="practical">
      <h2>// Exploitation patterns in undecidable zones</h2>
      <p>
        Threat actors exploit undecidability via:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Polymorphic engines: infinite semantic variants to evade signatures.</li>
        <li>JIT payload generation: delaying malicious behavior until post-verification runtime.</li>
        <li>Opaque predicates & environment-keyed logic: semantics shift depending on execution context.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each technique exploits the verifier's reliance on partial knowledge and bounded reasoning.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cyber-section" id="defense">
      <h2>// Self-modifying defenses & proof-carrying code</h2>
      <p>
        Proof-carrying code (PCC) enforces safety by shipping machine-checkable proofs with binaries. A Gödel Machine
        extends this idea: a self-rewriting system that applies only provably beneficial changes. In theory, PCC can
        prevent entire classes of exploits; in practice, proof soundness depends on trusted proof checkers and axioms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attackers who control the proof generator can subvert the process, injecting proofs that validate malicious
        rewrites. This is a direct parallel to Löb's theorem in modal logic: self-referential provability is a
        double-edged sword.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cyber-section" id="epilogue">
      <h2>// Operationalizing incompleteness</h2>
      <p>
        Accept that undecidability is not a flaw but a boundary condition. Combine formal verification for
        safety-critical subsystems with runtime anomaly detection, diversity, and human oversight. Architect systems to
        fail closed when axioms are violated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gödel showed the map will never cover the territory; in security, this means the proof will never cover the
        attack surface. But with the right mix of math, engineering, and paranoia, we can make the uncovered terrain
        hostile to the attacker instead of the defender.
